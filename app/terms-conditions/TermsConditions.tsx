      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>WAIVER OF SECTION 1542 OF THE CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE:</strong> YOU
      ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND SECTION 1542 OF THE
      CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE, WHICH STATES: “A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO
      CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER
      FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER
      MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.” YOU
      HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS UNDER THIS SECTION AND ANY SIMILAR LAWS
      OF OTHER JURISDICTIONS.
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>No Class Action</strong>
      <br />
      <br />
      You agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only
      on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated, or representative
      action. You further agree that you will not participate in any class
      action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this Agreement.
      Any claims brought by you or Call Sheet Media must be brought solely in
      your or its individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in
      any purported class or representative proceeding.
      <br />
      <br />
      If a court or arbitrator determines that the limitations in this section
      are unenforceable as to any claim, then such claim must be severed from
      the arbitration and may be brought in court. All other claims will proceed
      in arbitration.
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>Survivability</strong>
      <br />
      <br />
      The provisions of this Agreement concerning ownership, non-circumvention,
      non-disparagement, proprietary rights, confidentiality, payment
      obligations, and any others that, by their nature or context, are intended
      to survive, shall remain in effect following the termination or expiration
      of this Agreement.
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>Unsolicited Intellectual Property Submissions</strong>
      <br />
      <br />
      For your protection and ours, do not send any intellectual property,
      including, without limitation, screenplays, manuscripts, diaries, letters,
      essays, biographies, notes, ideas, or concepts to CSM without prior
      written permission from CSM. Any unsolicited materials received by CSM
      will not be reviewed and will be immediately deleted or destroyed. CSM
      assumes no responsibility for any unsolicited intellectual property
      submitted without prior written consent.
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>Confidentiality</strong>
      <br />
      <br />
      The terms and conditions of this Agreement, along with any information
      exchanged between the parties—including, but not limited to, emails,
      texts, letters, and notes—are confidential. This information shall not be
      disclosed publicly or to any third party without the prior written consent
      of the other party, except as required by law.
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>Indemnification</strong>
      <br />
      <br />
      You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless CSM, along with its
      shareholders, trustees, affiliates, and successors, from and against any
      and all liabilities and expenses—including, without limitation, claims,
      damages, judgments, awards, settlements, investigations, costs, attorneys'
      fees, and related disbursements—that may arise or result from: (i) CSM’s
      services, except in cases where such liabilities or expenses are due to
      CSM’s breach of this Agreement, gross negligence, or willful misconduct by
      CSM or any of its shareholders, trustees, affiliates, or successors; and
      (ii) your breach of any representations or warranties outlined in this
      Agreement.
      <br />
      <br />
      Except in the cases specified in item (i) above, you also agree to defend
      CSM in any legal or regulatory actions arising from or related to this
      Agreement. CSM acknowledges and agrees that none of its shareholders,
      trustees, affiliates, or successors shall bear personal responsibility or
      liability for any actions or representations made by CSM.
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>Miscellaneous</strong>
      <br />
      <br />
      • These Terms do not create any legal relationship between you and CSM.
      <br />
      • CSM’s failure to enforce a right does not mean that CSM has waived that
      right.
      <br />
      • If a court or other tribunal finds any provision of these Terms
      unenforceable, CSM will change that provision only to the extent necessary
      to make it enforceable. Other terms will remain in full force and effect.
      <br />
      • Any interpretation of these Terms will look at fair meaning, and
      ambiguities must not be construed for or against any party.
      <br />
      • CSM may assign its rights under these Terms, but you may not do so.
      <br />
      • These Terms, together with any other terms that you agree to when using
      the Site, comprise the entire agreement between CSM and you about your use
      of this Site.
      <br />
      • Headings are for reference only.
      <br />
      • These Terms supersede any prior agreements with CSM about using this
      Site and its content.
      <br />
      • CSM’s direct and indirect subsidiaries are third party beneficiaries of
      these Terms.
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>No Subterfuge</strong>
      <br />
      <br />
      You hereby represent and warrant that you are not using the Site or any
      Service offered on the Site for any purpose of deception, fraud, or
      subterfuge. Should you breach this warranty, this Agreement shall
      immediately terminate without notice. All sums paid will be forfeited and
      all outstanding sums will remain due. This clause is intended to protect
      the integrity of the Site and its Services and shall be enforced to the
      fullest extent permitted by law.
      <br />

      of the contest, as determined by Sponsor. The contest is a skill contest.
      No random drawing is used. Void where prohibited. Any attempt to undermine

      <br />
      <strong>Governing Law; Dispute Resolution</strong>
      <br />
      <br />
      This Agreement and any disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms,
      the Site, CSM Content, or your use of the Site (“Dispute”) shall be
      governed by the laws of the State of California, without regard to its
      conflict of laws principles. You agree to submit to the exclusive
      jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in Los Angeles
      County, California, and waive any objections to personal jurisdiction or
      venue in those courts.
      <br />
      <br />
      Before initiating any lawsuit regarding a Dispute, you and CSM agree to
      first attempt to resolve the Dispute through good-faith negotiation or
      mediation with a mutually agreed-upon mediator. Both parties will treat
      the existence and outcome of any negotiation or mediation as confidential.
      <br />
      <br />
      If the Dispute is not resolved within thirty (30) days of providing
      written notice to the other party, either party may pursue all available
      legal or equitable remedies. However, each party retains the right to seek
      temporary or emergency relief from a court of competent jurisdiction to
      prevent irreparable harm, preserve the status quo, address the expiration
      of a statute of limitations, or secure a priority position relative to
      other creditors.
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>Controlling Agreement</strong>
      <br />
      <br />
      In the event of any conflict between the provisions contained in this
      Agreement and any marketing materials used by CSM, CSM’s representatives,
      or employees, the provisions in this Agreement shall be controlling.
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>Partial Invalidity</strong>
      <br />
      <br />
      If any provision in this Agreement is held by a court of competent
      jurisdiction to be invalid, void, or unenforceable, the remaining
      provisions shall nevertheless continue in full force without being
      impaired or invalidated in any way.
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>Entire Agreement</strong>
      <br />
      <br />
      This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
      pertaining to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior and
      contemporaneous agreements, negotiations and understandings, oral or
      written. This Agreement may be modified only by an instrument in writing
      duly executed by both parties.
